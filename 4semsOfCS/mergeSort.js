// * very suitable if you're pretty sure a list is ALMOST sorted or likely sorted.

// * the big O??
// inner loop goes over sorted list to find correct place to insert the item, another outer loop to go over all the nums.
// * 2 loops = O(n2) ---> BUT if list is nearly sorted or so best case is O(n) AKA BEST SCENARIO ***
