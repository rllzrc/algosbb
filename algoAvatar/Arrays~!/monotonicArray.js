// ** AE: Arrays Reps Challenge  
// ** --> { Monotonic Array !!! }

// T A SK !!!

// Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a boolean representing whether the array is monotonic.

// An array is said to be monotonic if its elements, from left to right, are entirely non-increasing or entirely non-decreasing. 

// The elements aren't necessarily exclusively decreasing or increasing; they simply don't do either. 

// Note that empty arrays and arrays of one element are monotonic.
